# Applied and Computational Linear Algebra Repository

This repository contains structured notes, proofs, and computational implementations for MAT 315 (Topics in Linear Algebra), covering spectral theory, quadratic forms, SVD and pseudoinverses, QR and LU factorizations, Jordan canonical form, iterative methods, and applications to optimization, Markov chains, graphs, and systems of differential equations. Emphasis is placed on bridging linear algebra theory with numerical methods and real-world data science and computer science applications.

## What each component covers

- **Homework sets (`HW1` – `HW8`)**: Progressive exercises on spectral theory, orthogonality, projections, LU/QR decompositions, and iterative methods. Many sets include console transcripts (e.g., `HW1pt1.txt`) showing eigen-computation workflows in MATLAB/Octave.
- **Least-squares lab**: A guided investigation of overdetermined systems, normal equations, and QR-based solvers, with accompanying figures for residual analysis.
- **Markov chain lab**: Explores stochastic matrices, steady-state behavior, and mixing times through worked examples.
- **Image-processing lab**: Applies linear algebra tools to filtering and image transformation tasks, pairing narrative explanations with TIFF figures that illustrate each step.
